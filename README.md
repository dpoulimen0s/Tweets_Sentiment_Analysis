# Tweets Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral, based on their textual content. The analysis includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removal of special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary whitespace.
  - Tokenization of text for splitting sentences into words.
  - Lemmatization to normalize words to their base forms.
  - Stopword removal to reduce noise and improve focus on relevant words.

### Feature Engineering
- Converts text into numerical formats using:
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization**: To identify the importance of terms relative to the document.
  - **Word Embeddings**: For enhanced text representation, suitable for deep learning models.

### Machine Learning Models
- Implements various machine learning classifiers for sentiment prediction:
  - Logistic Regression.
  - Naive Bayes.
  - Random Forest.
  - XGBoost.

### Deep Learning Models
- Leverages advanced deep learning architectures for better performance:
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Captures sequential dependencies in text.
  - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Extracts spatial features from text sequences.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluates model performance using:
  - **Classification Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
  - **ROC-AUC Curves**: Assesses the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

### Visual Insights
- Includes visualizations to aid interpretation:
  - **Word Clouds**: Displays frequently occurring terms in tweets.
  - **Confusion Matrices**: Highlights prediction accuracy and errors.
  - **ROC Curves**: Visualizes model performance for various thresholds.

## Achievements
1. **Comprehensive Sentiment Classification**:
   - Accurately classifies tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
   - Extracts meaningful patterns and influential terms from the data.
2. **Diverse Modeling Techniques**:
   - Provides a comparison of traditional machine learning models and deep learning architectures.
3. **Detailed Performance Metrics**:
   - Comprehensive evaluation to determine the best-performing model for sentiment classification.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.).
2. Place the dataset(s) in the project directory.
3. Open and run the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and visualize the results.

## Example Visualizations
- **Word Cloud**: A graphical representation of the most frequent terms in the dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluates model performance by showing true/false positives and negatives.
- **ROC-AUC Curve**: Compares the sensitivity and specificity of different models.
